# Vulnly

Dependency vulnerability scanner for CI/CD pipelines.

## What it will do

- Scans npm and go dependencies (other language dependencies can be added later If I feel like it and fall in love with projet)
- Checks against OSV.dev vulnerability database
- Fails CI builds on critical vulnerabilities
- Dashboard to track trends over time


## Roadmap
 It could seem like roadmap is broken but that is just the way it is, I need to go around more in order to figure out more :)
 During the process of development, I will update the roadmap

- CLI scanner (npm, Go, I will see how it goes)
- OSV.dev integration
- Dashboard with trends
- Email alerts
- Slack integration (v2)
